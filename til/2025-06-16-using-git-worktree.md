# Using Git Worktree 

[git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) is a command that can be used to work on more than one branch at a time. It creates a seperate folder within your git repository that basically contains a new branch. 

This is exceedingly useful if you want AI to hack away on some branch while you keep working in the 'main' repository.

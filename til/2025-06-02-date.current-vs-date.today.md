# Date.current vs Date.today 

There is a subtle difference between `Date.today` and `Date.current`. The latter returns the date considering the current time zone, hence it's preferable to use that one. 

```ruby
# Current returns the date in the correct time zone
def current
  ::Time.zone ? ::Time.zone.today : ::Date.today
end
```
